# JWT-Authentication-and-Deployment
This project takes you on a journey to learn user authentication (using JWT). You will dive deep into deploying frontend and backend code, mastering NGINX and reverse proxies, and exploring many other crucial concepts that developers often struggle to find in one place

# The "Why" Behind This Project
As a learning developer, I constantly grappled with the concept of localhost. Everyone says "localhost is just a replica of a server," but that creates more questions than answers:

What actually is localhost?  If I'm building on my machine, how does the rest of the world eventually see it?
How do I connect the dots between my code and a live URL?

I spent months searching for a complete guide that explains the actual flow of a project—not just the code, but the infrastructure that holds it together. I built this repository to save you those months of confusion. This is the "Full Picture" guide I wish I had when I started.

#Broad Overview: What This Project Solves
This project moves beyond just "writing code" and dives into the architecture of a real-world application. We cover:

  => Authentication (JWT): Moving beyond simple logins to secure, token-based identity.

  => The Deployment Mindset: Transitioning your code from a local folder to a live, hosted environment.

  => NGINX & Reverse Proxy: Understanding the "Traffic Cop" of the internet. We explain how NGINX takes a request from the world and safely hands it over to your backend.

  => The Full Flow: A step-by-step realization of how frontend, backend, and server configurations communicate to turn your "local" work into a "global" product.

Stop guessing how the internet works—start building it.
